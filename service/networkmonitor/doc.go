// Package networkmonitor provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor.
//
// Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor is an Amazon Web Services active network
// monitoring service that identifies if a network issues exists within the Amazon
// Web Services network or your own company network. Within Network Monitor you'll
// choose the source VPCs and subnets from the Amazon Web Services network in which
// you operate and then you'll choose the destination IP addresses from your
// on-premises network. From these sources and destinations, Network Monitor
// creates a monitor containing all the possible source and destination
// combinations, each of which is called a probe, within a single monitor. These
// probes then monitor network traffic to help you identify where network issues
// might be affecting your traffic. For more information, see Using Amazon
// CloudWatch Network Monitor (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/what-is-network-monitor.html)
// in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
