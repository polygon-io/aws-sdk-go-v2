// Package qconnect provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// Amazon Q Connect.
//
// Powered by Amazon Bedrock: Amazon Web Services implements automated abuse
// detection (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/abuse-detection.html)
// . Because Amazon Q in Connect is built on Amazon Bedrock, users can take full
// advantage of the controls implemented in Amazon Bedrock to enforce safety,
// security, and the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon Q in
// Connect is a generative AI customer service assistant. It is an LLM-enhanced
// evolution of Amazon Connect Wisdom that delivers real-time recommendations to
// help contact center agents resolve customer issues quickly and accurately.
// Amazon Q automatically detects customer intent during calls and chats using
// conversational analytics and natural language understanding (NLU). It then
// provides agents with immediate, real-time generative responses and suggested
// actions, and links to relevant documents and articles. Agents can also query
// Amazon Q directly using natural language or keywords to answer customer
// requests. Use the Amazon Q in Connect APIs to create an assistant and a
// knowledge base, for example, or manage content by uploading custom files. For
// more information, see Use Amazon Q in Connect for generative AI powered agent
// assistance in real-time (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-q-connect.html)
// in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.
