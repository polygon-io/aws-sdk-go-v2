// Services maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones are
// physically isolated from each other, but are united by private, low-latency,
// high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These Availability
// Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy,
// while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability
// Zones that are available in each Region, see Amazon Web Services Global
// Infrastructure. (https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)
